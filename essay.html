        <h1>Supplemental Essay</h1>

        <h2>My Extracurricular Activities</h2>
        <p>I am absolutely passionate about being an advocate for my peers and creating a strong community. As the vice-president and a member of our school parliament, I work hard to maintain good relationships with both students and staff. Whether it’s planning events or being the bridge between teachers and students, I strive to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard.</p>
        
        <h2>Debating: My Passion for Critical Thinking</h2>
        <p>Debating is another area I am deeply engaged in. It has helped me develop critical thinking skills and confidence in public speaking. Despite my school’s debate club being inactive, I took the initiative to revive it this year. So far, I have participated in five debates across Russian and English leagues, mostly as a judge, but my favorite moment was leading the opposition team to victory.</p>
        
        <h2>Hacking the Education System</h2>
        <p>Ever since I received my first failing grade in fourth grade, I became fascinated with the structure of the education system. I realized that our country’s grading system heavily favors final yearly grades over quarterly performance. This discovery led me to optimize my study approach, ensuring that I maintained excellent grades early on while balancing my workload later in the year.</p>
